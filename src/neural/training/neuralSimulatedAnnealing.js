 * This class implements a simulated annealing training algorithm for neural
 * networks. It is based on the generic SimulatedAnnealing class. It is used in
 * the same manner as any other training class that implements the Train
 * interface. There are essentially two ways you can make use of this class.
 *
 * Either way, you will need a score object. The score object tells the
 * simulated annealing algorithm how well suited a neural network is.
 *
 * If you would like to use simulated annealing with a training set you should
 * make use TrainingSetScore class. This score object uses a training set to
 * score your neural network.
 *
 * If you would like to be more abstract, and not use a training set, you can
 * create your own implementation of the CalculateScore method. This class can
 * then score the networks any way that you like.
